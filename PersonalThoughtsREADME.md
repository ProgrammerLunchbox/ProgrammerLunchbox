Hello my name is Linsley but a a lot of my online friends call me Lunchbox. This read me has no real purpose other than to give a glimpse into my mind as I try to learn to code.
I'm a complete novice when it comes to coding and have restarted several times on my journey to become a professional programmer. 
I don't neccasarily have a knack for it or anything and its hard for me to focus on it but I still want to pursue this challenging path. 
Often times I find myself just staring at the screen and wondering what the hell am I looking at. 
It's frustrating but the feeling of figuring something out after hours of bashing my head into is great. 
That being said I would loved to get to the point where I have a polished set of tools under my belt and tackle things a little more tactically.

In my mind I see it as a way out, a way to make my true dreams a reality.
They are very materialistic and shallow but they are my dreams none the less. They are:
To own a Tesla, preferalbly a model S or 3 performance trim levels of either.
Have a reasonably sized house that has few neighbors where I can work from home most if not all the time.
I don't want money to be a concern and build a great sum of wealth while doing a job that allows me to be involved with interesting projects at the forfront of the tech industry.
Live a quiet life of peace. 

I dont need a super fancy life, I don't care for designer brand clothing or my social media status. 
Some may call me boring and thats completely fine with me as long as I'm truly happy with where I am.
